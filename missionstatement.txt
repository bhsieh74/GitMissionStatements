Founded in 2004, Facebook's mission statement at its essence is to give people the opportunity to connect with others, no matter the distance. Using the Facebook platform, users can share articles, photos, videos, and much more in order express their passions and even opinions. This allows people to build new relationships or make their current ones even stronger by bonding over similarities or even engaging in lively debate.
